# Welcome

Minerva is a framework to create GPGPU application using the Vulkan API. \
It tries to provide all necessary boiler plate code to make using the GPU as
simple as possible, albeit it might loose some minor performance in doing so.

Since Minerva uses the Vulkan API it runs on all major OS including Linux,
Windows, Mac, iOS and Android and all major GPU vendors as AMD, Intel, NVIDIA
or Qualcom.

This project was created as part for an assignment for university and should be
treated as a proof of concept.

See the [Quick Start](quickstart.md) for a start or dig right into the
[API documentation](modules.html).
